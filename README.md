Yggdrasil - The tree of life. From it, all things grow. 

This is a repo dedicated to an early-llm project I embarked upon. I attempted to create, before they even had a name, a RAG pipeline to help me write for Dungeons and Dragons. 
Within, you will find a series of fun artifacts, including an early document parser/chunker, some experimentation with a young version of langchain, an implementation of a local vector database, and some unfortunate recordings of mine and own and my friend's voices. 

These days, things like this have been eaten by Notebook LM, LLama Index and OpenAI.
I still look back fondly on these early attempts to play with fire.

Enjoy <3
