Stonegate: 
Lore Overview: 
Foundation of Stonegate: 
Stonegate was founded centuries ago by a group of enterprising dwarves who saw the strategic importance of the coastal cliff overlooking the Gemstone Sea. They built a sturdy stone wall around the city to protect themselves from outside threats and establish control over the region.
The Last Rippling: 
About 1000 years ago, during the last rippling, Stonegate faced a severe crisis. Evil forces threatened to overrun the city and bring chaos to the province. The dwarves fought valiantly and managed to repel the invasion, but the experience left a lasting impact on the city's leaders.
TO DO: 
Flesh this out
Relate to nethergloom / existential threat / wisp betrayal 
Preparations for Future Ripples: 
Recognizing the cyclical nature of the ripplings, the leaders of Stonegate realized the importance of being fully prepared for future upheavals. They began fortifying the city walls, bolstering their defenses, and investing heavily in dwarven industry to equip their forces with advanced weaponry and technology.
TO DO:
Flesh out battlements / fortifications / armaments 
Remember, stonegate will be an event to break into as well as a location, so it is important to set up these things early so the players have something work with when returning. 
The Shift to Magic: 
As the current rippling approached, the leaders of Stonegate acknowledged the growing prominence of magic in the world. They believed that harnessing magical forces would give them an upper hand in the coming crisis. The mages of Stonegate formed the Council of Arcane, which was tasked with exploring and unlocking the magical potential of the land.
TO DO:
List some magical artifacts that stonegate has already uncovered. 
List how they are being used in everyday activities in Stonegate. 
The Swallowed Swamp: 
Stonegate recognized the potential the swamp held for securing their dominance over the province. They knew the swamp was born of Lord Nethergloom and, after researching and performing some expeditions, they found that Nethergloom’s phylactery is likely still out there. They also found readings of magic in the region growing, and with great effort have learned of Finley’s plans only in the last 2 years or so. The people of Stonegate now plan to flip the phylactery to their own usage after Finley has had enough time to power it up. 
TO DO:
Recount some of those expeditions
Place some magic artifacts in the world the players may recover from the fallen expeditions. 
Flesh out Stonegate’s motivations in using Finley / his victims 
Flesh out how stonegate plans to leverage the phylactery’s power.
Shady Practices: 
In their desperation to maintain control and protect the province, Stonegate's leaders began employing questionable methods. They started forcing citizens to undergo magical experiments to enhance their loyalty and obedience. They also established a secret group within the city to monitor dissent and silence anyone who posed a threat to their authority.
TO DO: 
Flesh out these magical experiments. 
Present Day: 
Stonegate appears respected by the people of the province, but rumors of their shady practices have started to surface. The city's leaders continue their efforts to manipulate the rippling and use the Swallowed Swamp to further their goals, all while maintaining a facade of benevolence and protection.
