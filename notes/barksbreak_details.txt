Barksbreak: 
Lore: 
This tiny forestry village was sat right on the banks of Moradin’s Sprue
The village was the primary port for goods coming in / out of Timberhold, as it was a mere 1-day walk from the larger village. 
3 years ago, when Finley’s pursuits began to grow in intensity, the Swallowed Swamp began working across the bridge and encroaching on Barksbreak
At first, this was an inconvenience, forcing those in the village to cut back the swampland
Soon, incursions from swamp creatures and snagroot overwhelmed the small defense force
Adults and children began to go missing, and many started fleeing the village 
In the years following, the village has been overrun by swampland, vines, and creatures
Ground cover from The Swallowed Swamp has flooded the area with water from Moradin’s Sprue, allowing creatures from the swamp to make the area their home 
A noosebloom took root in the middle of the town
Shortly after, a small tribe of industrious Bullywugs found this abandoned village, and have created a symbiotic relationship with the noosebloom.

The bullywug tribe:
The tribe has thrived by symbiotically living with the Noosebloom
The tribe will lure larger creatures like crocagators, frogs, and swamp deer into the plant’s vines 
The bullywugs have a natural secretion which makes it difficult for the noosebloom to grab them. Combined with their excellent jumping abilities, they are able to easily avoid the noosebloom
They may attempt to get the players trapped in the noosebloom
They have had members stolen by The Painting, and will happily help the players if they reveal they are on a quest to stop the cloaked figure 
QUEST: 
If the players are nice to Boghop, he will reveal that his wife, Toadstool, is very sick and requires some special swamp plants to gather
Only problem, the plants are on the other side of a large canyon which the bullywugs are unable to traverse

The Chieftan’s Home: 
In barksbreak, the Chieftan’s house has been overrun by a giant NooseBloom which has taken residence on the outside. 
It has spawned a field of snagroot which grow out in wagon wheel spokes all around.
After defeating the bridgeman’s house and the mulgogi, the noosebloom will begin to wilt, and die after a few days. 
The chieftan’s house has already been raided by those evacuating from Barksbreak, as well as Cliff’s family 
Layout:
Entrances:
Front door:
Leads to town hall (open and accessible)
Back door:
Leads to chieftain’s quarter staircase (smashed open)
First Floor: 
Town Hall:
The hall is a once-grand space, now dilapidated and overgrown with noosebloom vines that cling to the walls and ceiling. Tangled strands of snagroot extend outward, ready to ensnare anything that makes a sound.
Has 4 doors built into the walls, one to each other room on the ground floor
DESCRIPTION: 
"As you step into the entrance hall, you are met with a chilling sight. Vines slither and writhe along the walls and ceiling, their dark tendrils reaching out hungrily. The room feels alive, the air heavy with an eerie anticipation."
Kitchen:
The kitchen area is in disarray, with overturned furniture, broken dishes, and remnants of decaying food. The lingering stench of rot fills the air, adding to the oppressive atmosphere.
DESCRIPTION: 
"Entering the kitchen, you are greeted by a scene of disarray. Broken plates and utensils litter the floor, mixed with decaying food. The stench of rot fills the air, making it hard to stomach the sight before you."
Study / Library:
The study is a small room with shelves lining the walls. However, the shelves are mostly empty, their contents scattered across the floor. Torn and yellowed parchment, damaged inkwells, and broken quills litter the room, signs of hurried departure and disregard.
DESCRIPTION:
“The study is in disarray, its shelves stripped of their knowledge. Torn parchments and shattered inkwells are scattered about, reminders of a time when this room brimmed with intellect and purpose."
Storage Room: 
The storage room holds the remnants of the village's supplies, now abandoned and deteriorated.
DESCRIPTION:
"Entering the storage room, you find yourself surrounded by shelves stacked with decayed remnants of the village's provisions. Broken crates and barrels lie scattered on the floor, their contents long since spoiled or devoured by pests. The musty aroma of rotting goods fills the air, an unpleasant reminder of what once sustained this community."
Chieftain’s Quarters: 
A staircase leads to a non-publicly accessible area of the building, where the chieftain typically lives. 
Second Floor:
Chieftain’s Study:
This is the first room one enters when going upstairs. 
A shattered room divider lies on the ground, where visitors would have once stood behind waiting for the chieftain to call them in. 
The study or library, features shelves filled with damaged books. Some have fallen to the floor, their pages crumpled and water-stained. A broken desk sits in the corner, its drawers empty and its surface covered in dust.
There is a hole in a wall where a safe once sat, clearly pried and prodded 
DESCRIPTION:
"This study or library is a somber scene of lost knowledge. Damaged books lie scattered on the floor, their pages crumpled and discolored. The broken desk stands as a symbol of interrupted endeavors."
Chieftain’s Bedroom:
The chieftain's bedroom is in disarray, with the bed upturned and personal belongings scattered across the floor. A cracked mirror hangs on one wall, reflecting a distorted image. A desk sits against another wall, its surface marred with ink stains and abandoned quills.
DESCRIPTION:
 "Entering the chieftain's bedroom, you are met with a sense of solemn abandonment. The bed lies upturned, its sheets torn and tangled. Personal belongings are strewn across the floor, a testament to the haste with which they were abandoned."
Balcony:
Accessed from the bedroom, the small balcony offers a view of the swampy surroundings. The wooden railing is warped and worn, providing a somewhat precarious vantage point. The distant croaking of frogs and the eerie silence of the abandoned village can be heard from here.
DESCRIPTION:
"Stepping onto the small balcony, the oppressive stillness of the village engulfs you. The once-proud view of the surrounding forest is now cloaked in an unsettling silence. You catch glimpses of twisted vegetation and hear the faint croaking of distant frogs."
